# In the diagram below, we created a list of lists named app_and_price, 
# and we want to extract the names of the free apps in a separate list. To do that, we'll do the following:

#     Create an empty list named free_apps.
#     Iterate over app_and_price. For each iteration, we do the following:
#         Extract the name of the app and assign it to a variable named name.
#         Extract the price of the app and assign it to a variable named price.
#         Append the name of the app to free_apps (the empty list that we initialized outside the loop) 
#         if the price of the app equals 0.

# The example above should help us better understand what we did on the first screen of this lesson, 
# where we extracted only the ratings of free apps. The steps we took above are the same as the ones we took on 
# the first screen when we used this snippet of code:

# img

# Above, we did the following:

#     Looped through a list of lists named apps_data. For every iteration, we did the following:
#         Extracted the rating of the app as a float and assigned it to a variable named rating.
#         Extracted the price of the app as a float and assigned it to a variable named price.
#         Appended the rating of the app to ratings (an empty list that we initialized outside the loop) 
#         if the price of the app equals 0.

# After we extracted the ratings of the free apps in a separate list, we computed the average value by adding up
#  all the ratings in that list and dividing the sum by the length of that list. However, we still need to compute 
# the average rating for non-free apps.

# When we isolated the free apps, we used the condition "if the price is equal to 0.0" (if price == 0.0). 
# To isolate the non-free apps, we need to change the condition to "if the price is not equal to 0.0." 
# For "is equal to," we can use the operator ==. For "is not equal to," we'll need to use the != operator.

# Below, we see an example of the != operator in use:

# img

# Let's also look at an example where we use a variable (price, in the example below) with the != operator:

# img

# In the exercise below, we're going to compute the average rating of non-free apps. 
# In the code editor on the right, we've already added the code we wrote on the first screen of this lesson to 
# compute the average rating of free apps.

# INSTRUCTIONS
# INITIAL CODE
opened_file = open('AppleStore.csv')
from csv import reader
read_file = reader(opened_file)
apps_data = list(read_file)

non_free_apps_ratings = []
for row in apps_data[1:]:
    rating = float(row[7])
    price = float(row[4])   
    if price != 0.0:
        non_free_apps_ratings.append(rating)
    
avg_rating_non_free = sum(non_free_apps_ratings) / len(non_free_apps_ratings)

avg_rating_free = 3.38

print(avg_rating_non_free )
print(avg_rating_free)

if avg_rating_non_free > avg_rating_free:
    print('Non free apps are better than free apps')


# Modify the existing code in the editor on the right to compute the average rating of non-free apps.

#     Change the name of the empty list from free_apps_ratings to non_free_apps_ratings (the list we defined before the for loop).
#     Change the condition if price == 0.0 to account for the fact that we now want to isolate only the ratings of non-free apps.
#     Change free_apps_ratings.append(rating) to make sure the ratings are appended to the new list non_free_apps_ratings.

#     Compute the average value by adding up the values in non_free_apps_ratings and dividing by the length of this list. Assign the result to avg_rating_non_free.

#     Optional exercise: Inspect the value of avg_rating_non_free and compare the average with that of the free apps (the average rating of free apps is approximately 3.38 â€” we computed it on the first screen). Can we use the average values to say that free apps are better than non-free apps, or vice versa?
