git init                                                           // start tracking current directory

git push -u origin main  


OPTION 4

We make a change in one branch, and we want carry that change to another branch. In order two merge two branches,
we need to
1. Switch to the branch where we want to take the changes to. git checkout master(recently changed to main)
2. Run the merge command by mentioning the branch name where the changes are. git merge develop 
    Takes the changes from develop and merges into my current branch (master)
    git branch -d <branch_name> deletes the branch.
    If we have unmerged changes, this command gives a warning and does not delete.
    git branch -D <branch_name> deletes the branch even if it has unmerged changes. Gives no warning.
    git push --set-upstream origin <branch_name> it creates a new branch with given name in the remote and pushes the
    changes from local branch to the new branch.
